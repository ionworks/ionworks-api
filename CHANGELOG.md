## [0.6.0] - 2026-05-04

### Added
- `skip_checks` parameter on validation entry points so callers with
  least-privileged API keys can opt out of project/permission checks
  while keeping schema validation (#534).
- Helpers on the client for uploading and managing custom PyBaMM
  models (#566).

### Changed
- UCP input is now backed by a machine-checkable JSON Schema, with
  parser parity tests ensuring the Python parser and schema agree
  (#494).
